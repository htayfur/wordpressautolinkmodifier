## ‚ùå Cancelled Features

1. Link Analytics:
   Reason: After evaluation, this feature was cancelled due to:
   - High database storage requirements
   - Potential performance impact
   - Better alternatives exist (e.g., Google Analytics)
   - Outside core plugin scope
   
   Alternative: We recommend using dedicated analytics tools that are better suited for link tracking and analysis.
